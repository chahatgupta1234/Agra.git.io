    Celebrations at Ram Barat - Events & Festivities
    The Ram Barat is held at just about the end of Navratri season and before the start of Dussehra. The Ram Barat is made doubly special with the three-day procession that is the centre of attraction during the festival. This procession is meant to be a symbol of the wedding procession that took the bride-groom all the way to the Janak Mahal.
    
    The parade passes different neighbourhoods every year, and each of these neighbourhoods takes out their most extravagant decorations and put them up in with all splendour every single year. The chariots or "raths" are the centre of attention during the 8-kilometre long procession, along with the many individuals who are dressed up as different characters from the myth. Several bands also accompany the people joining the parade and heighten the merry atmosphere to that of trance-like happiness.</p>
