    <p>You've seen it in history books, on postcards, and in social media posts. But now, you've made your way to India, and you finally have the chance to see this bucket list destination in real life.

        The magnificent structure dates back to the 17th century. Mughal emperor Shah Jahan was heartbroken after his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, passed away during childbirth, and decided to pay tribute to her with a white mausoleum. Construction took more than 20 years to complete and required the manpower of around 20,000 laborers.
        
        There's never a bad time to see the Taj Mahal, but it's worth getting here earlyâ€“the building seems to radiate at sunrise. Tourists can enter the UNESCO World Heritage Site via the west and east gates. Once inside, explore the ornamental gardens, which feature calming water features that reflect the Taj. Then, head inside the Taj itself and admire its perfect symmetry and white marble with elaborate floral cavings and semiprecious stone inlays.
        
        Sightseeing around the Taj Mahal complex continues at the Kau Ban Mosque, west of the Taj, and the Jawab, a building intended to mirror the mosque and preserve symmetry on the main structure's eastern side.</p>
