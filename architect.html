In tune with the reputation of being a pioneering institution in Central India, the Department of Architecture and Planning in 2007 introduced a Bachelor of Planning programme with an annual intake of 40 students. This programme aimed at meeting the variety of emerging needs of physical planning in the country.


Apart from these Undergraduate and Post-Graduation courses, more than 43 Doctoral degrees on various areas have been awarded by the Institute from the Department, whereas about 21 Doctoral researches are currently undergoing in the Department.
