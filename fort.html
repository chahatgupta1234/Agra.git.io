    <p>The Taj Mahal isn't the only UNESCO World Heritage Site in Agraâ€“the city is also home to Agra Fort, a centuries-old red sandstone fortress that was once the imperial city for a succession of Mughal rulers.

        Sightseeing here is like wandering around a city within a city. The most extraordinary building at Agra Fort is Jahangir Mahal, a massive palace that blends stunning Hindu-inspired features (like overhanging enclosed balconies) with Central Asian architectural elements (such as the signature pointed arches). Inside, tourists can see the gilded central court where royal women once passed their days.
        
        Tourists can also check out a range of other noteworthy structures, including Anguri Bagh (a courtyard with puzzle piece-like outlines of gardens around water channels), Khas Mahal (a palace with pavilions made of white marble and red sandstone), Musamman Burj (an octagonal tower with intricate marble inlay work), and Diwan-i-Khas (a gathering hall featuring a pair of black and white marble thrones).
        
        With so much to see, Agra Fort will require at least a few hours on your itinerary. It makes for a great afternoon stop after a morning at the Taj Mahal.</p>
