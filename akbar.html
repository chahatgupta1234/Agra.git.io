  <p>Tomb of Akbar, Agra Overview
    The final resting place of Mughal Emperor Akbar, Akbar's Tomb is situated in Sikandra, the outskirts of Agra and spreads over an area of 119 acres. An important architectural masterpiece of the Mughal era, it was built between 1605 and 1618. Built entirely out of sandstone and white marble, Emperor Akbar himself oversaw the construction of this tomb until his death. Unlike the other tombs of famous Muslim kings around the world, the Tomb of Akbar faces towards the rising sun instead of Masjid of Mecca.
    
    The main tomb is surrounded by a beautiful garden that was designed by Akbar himself. His wife's (Mariam-uz-Zamani Begam) tomb is also located in Sikandra about a kilometre away from Akbar's Tomb. Following Tartary traditions, that state that one must see-through the construction of one's tomb themselves, Akbar lived through the construction of his tomb and built a beautiful garden around it.</p>
