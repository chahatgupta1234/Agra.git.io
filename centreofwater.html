<h2>CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE IN WATER MANAGEMENT</h2>
<p>Water is a valuable natural resource, and its depletion, misuse, and disruption of the water cycle result in its scarcity for domestic, industrial, and agricultural usage. Proper management  of water is need of today. Centre of Excellence in Water  Management  is associated with Department of Civil Engineering, MANIT, Bhopal. This Centre of Excellence in water management is being developed to offer a unique platform for  research  and developments  for management of water which is in harmony with initiative of Jal Shakti Niyojan Vibhag of the Government of India.

    The centre is providing quality education and research focussed to water resources   engineering & management, iSnce 2021, the centre offers Post Graduate program on “Water Resporces Engineering and Management” to facilitate the culture pf developing unique ideas in water resource management
    
    Faculty members are highly skilled and competent, and the department has enough facilities to assist teaching and learning. As a result, it is dedicated to the well-being and overall development of its students.</p>
