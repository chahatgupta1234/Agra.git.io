    <h1> Mehtab Bagh</h1>

  <p>Mehtab Bagh is a charbagh garden complex and one of the last Mughal gardens in Agra. It is located just north to the Taj Mahal and overlooks the Agra Fort and Yamuna river on the opposite side. Perfectly aligned with the gardens of Taj Mahal, Mehtab Bagh provides a picture-perfect view of the Taj from the fountain at the front of the entrance gate. It is a popular sunset spot among the photography fanatics and nature enthusiasts.

    The splendid Mehtab Bagh has four sandstone towers, one each at the corner with a huge octagonal tank right in the centre. It is believed that Shah Jahan especially got the bagh designed for his personal interests so he could come up here and admire the infinite beauty of Taj Mahal. On the moonlit nights, the clear reflection of the wondrous Taj Mahal in the waters of the park is a sight beyond description. Mehtabh Bagh is now a horticulture delight with scores of vibrantly blooming floral plants and medicinal herbs, besides the umpteen fruit trees, which add to the beauty of the park.</p>
